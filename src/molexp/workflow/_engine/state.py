"""Internal workflow-engine state and deps types.

Users never import these directly — they touch them only through the
public ``WorkflowResult`` API.

data containers threaded through the per-task node bodies driven by

    The engine holds a single reference to this object for the whole run.
    Tasks receive their inputs from upstream outputs (values-on-edges); the
    shared ``results`` dict is the run's output ledger — each completed node
    records ``results[name] = output`` in place, and downstream ``depends_on``
    collection reads from it.

    Fields:

    * ``results`` — task_name → output as tasks finish; loops overwrite
      prior values ("曾经完成过一次" semantics).
    * ``completed`` — names of tasks that finished at least once.
    * ``loop_counters`` — per-loop ``until``-task → iteration count; the
      engine increments and consults this to enforce
      ``wf.loop(..., max_iters=N)``.
    * ``parallel_runs`` — ``wf.parallel`` body fan-out width, recorded when
      the fan-out publishes (observability).
    * ``failed`` / ``error`` — terminal failure flags.
    * ``seeded`` — names that arrived already-completed via
      ``Workflow.execute(seed_outputs=...)``; their node skips the body
      but still routes normally.

        parallel_decls: ``body_task_name → ParallelDecl``.
        loop_max_iters: ``until_task_name → max_iters`` (``wf.loop`` guard).

            one fresh limiter per parallel body, sized to

        cache: Optional content-addressed :class:`~molexp.workflow.cache.Caching`.
            ``None`` (default) disables caching — the per-task Step hook
            behaves exactly as before. The runtime resolves the effective

            back to the cache (the ``--fresh`` escape hatch; see
